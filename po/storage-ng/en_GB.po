#. Proposal client to show the list of storage actions.
#.
#. This client is used in autoyast summary dialog, where a new
#. client instance is created with each event that requires to
#. update the summary dialog content.
#.
#. To manage collapsing/expanding subvolumes list it is necessary
#. to save the previous state of that list, but it is not possible
#. to do that in the client instance itself because a new client
#. instance is created each time.
#.
#. To solve that, instance class attributes are used. PartitionsProposal
#. class has an internal state that is updated with each object creation.
#.
#. @see PartitionsProposal.update_state
