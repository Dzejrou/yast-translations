"<p><b><big>Bind Network Address</big></b><br>This  specifies  the  address "
"which the openais executive should bind.  This address should always end in  "
"zero.   If  the  totem traffic  should  be routed over 192.168.5.92, set "
"bindnetaddr to 192.168.5.0.<br>This may also be an IPV6 address, in which "
"case IPV6  networking will  be used.  In this case, the full address must be "
"specified and there is no automatic selection  of  the  network  interface "
"within a specific subnet as with IPv4. If IPv6 networking is used, the "
"nodeid field must be specified.<br></p>\n"
"<p><b><big>Multicast Address</big></b><br>This is the multicast address used "
"by  openais  executive.   The default  should work for most networks, but "
"the network administrator should be queried  about  a  multicast  address  "
"to  use.  Avoid 224.x.x.x because this is a \"config\" multicast address."
"<br>This  may  also be an IPV6 multicast address, in which case IPV6 "
"networking will be used.  If IPv6 networking is used, the nodeid field must "
"be specified.</p>\n"
"<p><b><big>Port</big></b><br>This  specifies  the UDP port number.  It is "
"possible to use the same multicast address on a network with  the  openais  "
"services configured for different UDP ports.<br></p>\n"
"<p><b><big>Member Address</big></b><br>This list specifies all the nodes in "
"the cluster by IP address. This could be configurable when using "
"udpu(Unicast). <br></p>\n"
"<p><b><big>Node ID</big></b><br>This  configuration  option  is  optional  "
"when  using  IPv4 and required when using IPv6.  This is a 32 bit value "
"specifying the node identifier delivered to the cluster membership service.  "
"If this is not specified with IPv4, the node id will be  determined from  "
"the  32  bit  IP address the system to which the system is bound with ring "
"identifier of 0.  The node identifier  value  of zero is reserved and should "
"not be used.<br></p>\n"
"<p><b><big>rrp_mode</big></b><br>This specifies the mode of redundant ring, "
"which  may  be  none, active,  or  passive.   Active replication offers "
"slightly lower latency from transmit to delivery in faulty network "
"environments but  with less performance.  Passive replication may nearly "
"double the speed of the totem  protocol  if  the  protocol  doesn't become  "
"cpu bound.  The final option is none, in which case only one network "
"interface will be used to operate the  totem  protocol.  If  only one "
"interface directive is specified, none is automatically chosen.  If multiple "
"interface directives  are  specified, only active or passive may be chosen."
"<br></p>\n"
"<p><b><big>Expected votes</big></b><br>Expect vote number for voting "
"quorum.  Will be automatically calculated when the nodelist {} section is "
"present in corosync.conf (the list will be generated when using unicast "
"transport) or can be specified in the quorum {} section (Expect votes should "
"use the total node numble of the cluster). If Expected votes presents in "
"unicast transport, the value will override the one automatically calculated."

"<p><b><big>Enable Security Auth</big></b><br>This  specifies  that HMAC/SHA1 "
"authentication should be used to authenticate all messages.  It further "
"specifies that  all  data should  be  encrypted  with the sober128 "
"encryption algorithm to protect data from eavesdropping.  Enabling this "
"option adds a 36 byte header to every message sent by totem which reduces "
"total throughput.  Encryption and authentication consume 75% of CPU cycles "
