"<p><b><big>IP Version</big></b><br>Specifies version of IP to use for "
"communication. Value can be one of ipv4 or ipv6. Default (if unspecified) is "
"ipv4.<br></p>\n"
"<p><b><big>Bind Network Address</big></b><br>This  specifies  the  address "
"which the openais executive should bind.  This address should always end in  "
"zero.   If  the  totem traffic  should  be routed over 192.168.5.92, set "
"bindnetaddr to 192.168.5.0.<br>This may also be an IPV6 address, in which "
"case IPV6  networking will  be used.  In this case, the full address must be "
"specified and there is no automatic selection  of  the  network  interface "
"within a specific subnet as with IPv4. If IPv6 networking is used, the "
"nodeid field must be specified.<br></p>\n"
"<p><b><big>Multicast Address</big></b><br>This is the multicast address used "
"by  openais  executive.   The default  should work for most networks, but "
"the network administrator should be queried  about  a  multicast  address  "
"to  use.  Avoid 224.x.x.x because this is a \"config\" multicast address."
"<br>This  may  also be an IPV6 multicast address, in which case IPV6 "
"networking will be used.  If IPv6 networking is used, the nodeid field must "
"be specified.</p>\n"
"<p><b><big>Port</big></b><br>This  specifies  the UDP port number.  It is "
"possible to use the same multicast address on a network with  the  openais  "
"services configured for different UDP ports.<br></p>\n"
"<p><b><big>Member Address</big></b><br>This list specifies all the nodes in "
"the cluster by IP address. This could be configurable when using "
"udpu(Unicast). <br></p>\n"
"<p><b><big>Node ID</big></b><br>This  configuration  option  is  optional  "
"when  using  IPv4 and required when using IPv6.  This is a 32 bit value "
"specifying the node identifier delivered to the cluster membership service.  "
"If this is not specified with IPv4, the node id will be  determined from  "
"the  32  bit  IP address the system to which the system is bound with ring "
"identifier of 0.  The node identifier  value  of zero is reserved and should "
"not be used.<br></p>\n"
"<p><b><big>rrp_mode</big></b><br>This specifies the mode of redundant ring, "
"which  may  be  none, active,  or  passive.   Active replication offers "
"slightly lower latency from transmit to delivery in faulty network "
"environments but  with less performance.  Passive replication may nearly "
"double the speed of the totem  protocol  if  the  protocol  doesn't become  "
"cpu bound.  The final option is none, in which case only one network "
"interface will be used to operate the  totem  protocol.  If  only one "
"interface directive is specified, none is automatically chosen.  If multiple "
"interface directives  are  specified, only active or passive may be chosen."
"<br></p>\n"
"<p><b><big>Cluster Name</big></b><br>This specifies the name of cluster and "
"it's used for automatic generating of multicast address. Default is "
"hacluster. For a geo cluster, each cluster must have a unique name.<br></p>\n"
"<p><b><big>Expected votes</big></b><br>Expect vote number for voting "
"quorum.  Will be automatically calculated when the nodelist {} section is "
"present in corosync.conf (the list will be generated when using unicast "
"transport) or can be specified in the quorum {} section (Expect votes should "
"use the total node numble of the cluster). If Expected votes presents in "
"unicast transport, the value will override the one automatically calculated. "
"For safety, the Expected votes will be disabled once nodelist not empty, "
"it's good for ignore the inappropriate Expected votes set.<br></p>\n"
"<p><b><big>Auto Generate Node ID</big></b><br>Nodeid is required when using "
"IPv6. Auto node ID enabled will generate nodeid automatically.<br></p>\n"

"<p><b><big>Model</big></b><br>Specifies the model to be used. This parameter "
"is required.  corosync-qdevice is modular and is able to support multiple "
"different models. The model basically defines what type of arbitrator is "
"used. Currently only 'net' is supported.</p>\n"
"<p><b><big>Host</big></b><br>Specifies the IP address or host name of the "
"qnetd server to be used. This parameter is required.</p>\n"
"<p><b><big>Port</big></b><br>Specifies TCP port of qnetd server. Default is "
"5403.</p>\n"
"<p><b><big>TLS</big></b><br>Can be one of 'on', 'off' or 'required' and "
"specifies if tls should be used. 'on' means a connection with TLS is "
"attempted first, but if the server doesn't advertise TLS support then non-"
"TLS will be used. 'off' is used then TLS is not required and it's then not "
"even tried. This mode is the only one which doesn't need a properly "
"initialized NSS database. 'required' means TLS is required and if the server "
"doesn't support TLS, qdevice will exit with error message. 'on' need "
"manually change, refer to corosync-qdevice's man page for more details. "
"Default is 'off' in yast.</p>\n"
"<p><b><big>Algorithm</big></b><br>Decision algorithm. Can be one of the "
"'ffsplit' or 'lms'.  (Actually there are also 'test' and '2nodelms', both of "
"which are mainly for developers and shouldn't be used for production "
"clusters, so yast will convert to 'ffsplit' automatically). For a "
"description of what each algorithm means and how the algorithms differ see "
"their individual sections.  Default value is ffsplit.</p>\n"
"<p><b><big>Tie breaker</big></b><br>Can be one of 'lowest', 'highest' or "
"'valid_node_id' (number) values. It's used as a fallback if qdevice has to "
"decide between two or more equal partitions. 'lowest' means the partition "
"with the lowest node id is chosen. 'highest' means the partition with "
"highest node id is chosen. And 'valid_node_id' means that the partition "
"containing the node with the given node id is chosen. Default is 'lowest'.</"
"p>\n"
"<p><b><big>Qdevice Heuristics</big></b><br>Subsection of Qdevice. Heuristics "
"are set of commands executed locally on startup, cluster membership change, "
"successful connect to corosync-qnetd and optionally also at regular times. "
"Commands are executed in parallel. When *all* commands finish successfully "
"(their return error code is zero) on time, heuristics have passed, otherwise "
"they have failed. The heuristics result is sent to corosync-qnetd and there "
"it's used in calculations to determine which partition should be quorate.</"
"p>\n"
"<p><b><big>Heuristics Mode</big></b><br>Can be one of on, sync or off and "
"specifies mode of operation of heuristics. Default is off, which  means  "
"heuristics are disabled. When sync is set, heuristics are executed only "
"during startup, membership change and when connection to corosync-qnetd is "
"established. When heuristics should be running also on regular basis, this "
"option should be set to on value.</p>\n"
"<p><b><big>Heuristics Timeout</big></b><br>Specifies maximum time in "
"milliseconds. How long corosync-qdevice waits till the heuristics commands "
"finish. If some command doesn't finish before the timeout, it's killed and "
"heuristics fail. This timeout is used for heuristics executed at regular "
"times. Default value is half of the quorum.device.timeout, so 5000.</p>\n"
"<p><b><big>Heuristics Sync_timeout</big></b><br>Similar to quorum.device."
"heuristics.timeout but used during membership changes. Default value is half "
"of the quorum.device.sync_timeout, so 15000.</p>\n"
"<p><b><big>Heuristics Interval</big></b><br>Specifies interval between two "
"regular heuristics execution. Default value is 3 * quorum.device.timeout, so "
"30000.</p>\n"
"<p><b><big>Heuristics exec_NAME</big></b><br>Defines executables. *NAME* can "
"be arbitrary valid cmap key name string and it has no special meaning. The "
"value of this variable must contain a command to execute. The value is "
"parsed (split) into arguments similarly as Bourne shell would do. Quoting is "
