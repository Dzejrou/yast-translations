#. The most often problem which is reported by users regarding scanner setup is

#. Determine if any kind of firewall seems to be active by calling
#. "iptables -n -L | egrep -q 'DROP|REJECT'"
#. to find out if there are currently dropping or rejecting packet filter rules.
#. One might use a more specific test via
#. "iptables -n -L | grep -v '^LOG' | egrep -q '^DROP|^REJECT'"
#. to match only for DROP and REJECT targets and exclude LOG targets
#. but it does not cause real problems when there is a false positive result here
#. because all what happens it that then a needless firewall info popup would be shown.
#. If any kind of firewall seems to be active, show a popup message
#. regarding scanning via network and firewall.
