#. there is no longer a "abort" functionality which exits the whole module.
#. Instead this button is now named "Cancel" and its functionality is
#. to go back to the Overview dialog (i.e. what the "back" button would do)
#. because it reads "Cancel - Closes the window and returns to the overview."

"It is recommended to avoid reserved characters and spaces\n"

"(e.g. you cannot avoid it when you must specify such characters\n"
"in values for an URI to access a remote print queue\n"

"Unreserved characters are uppercase and lowercase letters,\n"

"could cause special issues in special cases\n"
"(e.g. only letters, digits, and underscore are known to work\n"
"for a CUPS print queue name and case is not significant there).\n"
"Therefore it is best to use only lowercase letters, digits,\n"
"and underscore for all values in all URIs if possible.<br>\n"
"Reserved characters and space characters in the value of a component\n"
"must be percent-encoded (also known as URL encoding).<br>\n"
"When an input field in the dialog is intended to enter\n"
"only a single value for a single component of the URI\n"
"(e.g. separated input fields for username and password),\n"
"you must enter spaces and reserved characters literally\n"

"For example if a password is actually 'Foo%20Bar' (non-percent-encoded),\n"
"it must be entered literally in the password input field in the dialog.\n"
"The automated percent-encoding results 'Foo%2520Bar' which is how\n"
"the value of the password component is actually stored in the URI.<br>\n"
"In contrast when an input field in the dialog is intended to enter\n"
"more that a single value for a single component of the URI\n"
"(e.g. a single input field for all optional parameters\n"
"like 'option1=value1&amp;option2=value2&amp;option3=value3'\n"
"or a single input field to enter the whole URI),\n"
"you must enter spaces and reserved characters percent-encoded\n"
"because an automated percent-encoding is no longer possible.\n"
"Assume in an optional parameter 'option=value'\n"
"the value would be 'this&amp;that' so that the whole\n"
"optional parameter would be 'option=this&amp;that' (literally).\n"

#. (e.g. exit its graphics printing mode and switch back to normal mode).
#. The backend process terminates when the filters have finished.
#. This helps in usual cases (in particular when a good driver is used)
#. if something had messed up for an actively printing job but
#. unfortunately there is no option for the "cancel" command
#. which lets the cupsd kill the backend process as emergency brake
#. when something is really wrong e.g. a wrong driver lets the printer
