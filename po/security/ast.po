#. * File:	include/security/widgets.ycp
#. * Module:	Security configuration
#. * Summary:	Security widgets definitions
#. * Authors:	Michal Svec <msvec@suse.cz>
#. *
#. * $Id$
#. *
#. * This file contains the definitions of all widgets used by the
#. * security module. They are all in one map (function) called
#. * WIDGETS.
#.
#. <pre>
#.
#. The WIDGETS format:
#. -------------------
#.
#. map WIDGETS = $[
#. "Item unique ID" : $[
#. "Widget" : "ComboBox",
#. "Label" : "Item Label",
#. "Options" : [ "option1", "option2", ... ],
#. "Value" : "option2"
#. ],
#. ...
#. ];
#.
#. The "Value" is the current value of this option and one from "Options".
#.
#. Particular "Options" can be either <string> or [ <string>, <string> ]. In the
#. latter case, the first string is used as ID and the second is displayed. For
#. example: [ "option1", ["option2",_("Option2 translation")], ... ].
#.
#. Possible "Widget" values so far: "ComboBox, CheckBox, TextEntry".
#.
#. Implementation:
#. ---------------
#.
#. map2widget("ID")
#. - look up the "ID" in the "WIDGETS" map
#. - create the widget
#.
#. widget2value("ID")
#. - query UI for the widget with `id(ID)
#. - return its current value
#.
#. updatewidget("ID")
#. - look up the "ID" and change its "Value" to the "val"
#. - updates the WIDGETS map
#. - called after start and after each subdialog [OK]
#. - must check if the value is in "Options"! (TODO)
#.
#. processinput()
#. - return true (OK) or false (abort, back, nil, help!, ...)
#.
#. </pre>
#.
#. *
#. @return [Hash] all widgets
